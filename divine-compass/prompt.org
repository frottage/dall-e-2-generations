In metaphilosophy and ethics, meta-ethics is the study of the nature, scope,
and meaning of moral judgment. It is one of the three branches of ethics
generally studied by philosophers, the others being normative ethics (questions
of how one ought to be and act) and applied ethics (practical questions of
right behavior in given, usually contentious, situations).
